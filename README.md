# InrTracker
Logging and graphing your INR results.


I have a rare genetic disorder called Antithrombin 3 deficiency. Because of that, I'm on a blood thinner and need to test my blood at varying times to determine what my INR is. INR is short for International Normalized Ratio which, you can read more about here https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/prothrombin-time/about/pac-20384661 . 


I already have a medical device to test my blood so I can bypass the labs. However it's not mine, it belongs to the company that makes it. I need something to track my levels because I can get tested anywhere. I need something better than a notebook to write this down for historical purposes. So, if you're like me and have this check this software out once it's matured because it will be a while.

The birth of this software will come with:

1) The ability to input your INR attaching it to a time and date stamp as well as including your dosage. 
2) The data will be stored in a sql database.
3) The ability to export to text, csv, excel and an odf format.
4) A graphical representation of the level.
